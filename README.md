Example of an issue for <https://github.com/mkkellogg/GaussianSplats3D>

(repo will be deleted once resolved)

The way this is implemented doesnt seem to be important, with the default dropin scene you can achieve the same results by setting it to dynamic and adding a scene

If this is intentional, it should be documented.

## TODO:

- Refactor script
- Test if the same thing happens with normal viewer (not dropin)
